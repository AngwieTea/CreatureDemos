This is the plugin for [Creature](http://creature.kestrelmoon.com/), the **Advanced 2D Skeletal and Mesh Animation Tool**. This plugin is for the **Unreal Engine aka UE4** pipeline. It allows you to load in, play back and control your authored Creature Characters in the UE4 environment. Character playback and control are done through Creature's Blueprints enabled functionality.
