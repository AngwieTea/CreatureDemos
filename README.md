##Creature British Library Art Project
A demo scene consisting of multiple characters with artwork all sourced from the public domain [British Library Flickr Archive](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/albums) is presented here. This demo is constructed in UE4 so you will need UE4.9 and above to open to run the project.

The scene demonstrates multiple advanced features of the Creature Animation Tool, including the usage of ***Force Field Motors for Cloth Dynamics, Custom Cycle Motors for walking and the Creature UE4 Runtime.***

The actual animation logic for the walking pheasants and tapir is all authored using the UE4 Blueprints system.
